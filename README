cbbncd-0.16

This is an FTP control channel bouncer.
It works with glftpd and any other ftpd that supports IDNT.
The connection data is embedded into the executable and is (optionally)
encrypted with AES-256.

Build dependencies: make g++ openssl libssl-dev libc6-dev

To compile, run: make
You will be asked for connection details during compilation.

When encryption is selected, no potentially sensitive data will be stored
in the build directory.
When compilation is finished, everything except the executable can be
removed.

The connection details can also be specified on the command line when
compiling, to avoid interactive questions. Example:
make PORT=65432 HOST=ftp.example.com:21 IDENT=n
This will compile without interaction and with data encryption disabled.
For non-interactive compilation with encryption enabled, the DATA parameter
can be used:
make DATA=encrypted-data-string
The encrypted-data-string can be retrieved by checking the resulting
BNCDATA parameter in the final link command during regular interactive
compilation.
