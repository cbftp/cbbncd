cbbncd-0.12

This is a simple FTP bouncer.
It works with glftpd and any other ftpd that supports IDNT.
The connection data is embedded into the executable and is (optionally)
encrypted with AES-256.

Build dependencies: make g++ openssl libssl-dev libc6-dev

To compile, run: make
You will be asked for connection details during compilation.

When encryption is selected, no potentially sensitive data will be stored
in the build directory.
When compilation is finished, everything except the executable can be
removed.
